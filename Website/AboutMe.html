        Life Information
        <p>I am currently a senior and I have attended Pasadena High School for all four years and have been in the App Academy since I've arrived here.
        In the time that I have been in this program I have enjoyed in and have learned many kinds of things, I think that my favorite part about this is that nothing is really wrong as far as making a game or website.
        You get to make whatever you want in any style or format that you want it in.
        I personally like and prefer to make a website or work on one than making a game or mobile app.
        I plan on going into a field of this program because it is something that I like and enjoy doing.<p>
