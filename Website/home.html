        <p> Welcome to my website.
          This project is based on myself, my experiences in life, school, the app academy and other things that I have going on for myself.
          This project contains information about myself, what I have learned and what I think of doing in the future and my career plans.
          Since it is my final project I decided to make it on myself because there is no website in world that is based on me.

          I plan to come back to this one day and maybe change it so that it can be my own personal landing page so that wherever I go I have a website that I can present and show what I am capable of doing.
