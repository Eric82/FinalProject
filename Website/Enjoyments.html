        <p> This page is about the things that I enjoy and like to do on my free time or just things that about me that I like or entertain me.
           When I have free time I enjoy to go out with friends and stuff.
           But when I have my free time to myself I like to do get things done that I need to do such as clean wash or paper work.
           I like to exercise and go on hikes whenever I have free time on the weekends.
           As a kid I have always like video game and I thing that video games will always have a spot in my life.
           Seeing how summer is coming up I plan to work out and exercise as much as I can because after this I will be busy and begin to attend college and work as well.
